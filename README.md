## For a more streamline, integrated experience, please use "Link Shell Extension"
[Link Shell Extension has a very similar clone feature](https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html#hardlinkclones). I recommend using it as it is more integrated into the File Explorer and has visual distinctions for the folders and files it makes. It's also a more mature product, which this project could've been, but seeing as it's effectively the same but better, I might switch this now-dead project to a GUI manager and launcher of apps and folders that are cloned this way.

Folder Cloner for Windows In Python 3.11+

Clone big folders without the doubling the space they take on your drives! Uses Hard Links provided by the Windows CMD command `mklink` with the `/h` switch.

I personally made this to use it with big games when I want to modify them for singleplayer/ always-offline use to isolate the modded game from the online game, without having to fill my poor HDD.

Enjoy!
